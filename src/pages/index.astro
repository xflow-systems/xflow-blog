			<h1>What is XFlow?</h1>

			<p>
				XFlow is an ambitious attempt to <b>reimagine the modern hardware and software stack</b>.
			</p>

			<h3>
				What does this New Stack Look Like?
			</h3>

			<p>
				At the lowest level of XFlow's stack will be an FPGA bytestream generator.
			</p>

			<p>
				Essentially this allows a digital circuit to be created from scratch.
			</p>

			<p>
				Above that will be a language <code>xflow-lang</code> and a database <code>xflow-qengine</code>.
				This language will allow the database to be queried and will be built on tech from <code>Timely Dataflow</code>
				that allows ultra-efficient incremental queries.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Above this data layer will be a UI layer as well as a Network layer.
			</p>

			<h3>
				What Advantages does this New System Bring?
			</h3>

			<ul class="list-decimal">
				<li>
					<b>Radical Simplicity</b> - we're building on raw digital circuits
 				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Mathematically Proven</b> - proofs are used to verify functionality
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>A Novel Architecture</b> - built from zero to handle incremental graph computations
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Security / Reliability</b> - uses orders of magnitude less code than a traditional stack
				</li>
